## i3hub


The i3hub meta-platform is finally online and ready to be used! 
It has been a long time in development and we probably missed something. What? We don't know. We have also prepared a (hopefully) comprehensive documentation that will guide you through the development of your service. But now let's get down to business, why have we created this repo?

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://docs.hub.i3lab.group/) of the project.

We kindly ask you to report here all the things that are wrong with the material we have provided. E.g. platform bugs, inaccuracies in the documentation, missing piece in the explanation of an instruction and anything else. In this way we can respond to your problems in a short time and try to solve them as soon as possible. We are counting on your support for this final stage of development.
